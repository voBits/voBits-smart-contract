## Development

### Setting up a development environment
Requirements:
* Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* git client (https://git-scm.com/download/)

Setup:
1. Install truffle: `npm install -g truffle`
2. On Windows install the necessary build tools: `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`
3. Install Ganache from: http://truffleframework.com/ganache/
4. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/forkdelta/smart_contract.git
5. Change into the root directory: `cd smart_contract`
6. Install all node.js requirements from package.json: `npm install`
7. If you use VSCode, copy `.vscode\settings.json.default` to `.vscode\settings.json` for a reasonable solhint linter configuration

### Migrating and testing with Ganache
* Start ganache
* Compile: `truffle compile`
* Migrate: `truffle migrate`
* Run test cases: `truffle test`

### Migrating and testing with truffle develop
* `truffle develop`
* Compile: `compile`
* Migrate: `migrate`
* Run test cases: `test`

### Migrating to the live/production chain
* Edit "live" section in `truffle.js`:
* Set reasonable gas price based on https://ethgasstation.info
* Start local ethereum node (geth/parity) and set connection parameters in `truffle.js` 
* Set/verify creation parameter for ForkDelta contract in `./migrations/2_deploy_contracts_js`  
* Unlock account in geth/parity that is used for deploying the contract (first account or the one specified with "from" in `truffle.js`)
* `truffle migrate -network=live`
